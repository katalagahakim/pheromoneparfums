## Pheromonexs - Reddit User Reviews

We've collected **4 real user reviews** from r/pheromones. Here's what people are saying:


### Review 1 - "Starter Guide for Pheromone Newcomers"

What’s up, all? With more and more people joining the sub and information being a bit scattered, I'd like to go over some basics for newcomers to pheromones. So, let’s get it!

**Introduction**

Pheromones can be subtle, yet powerful, and can make life-changing impacts in our lives, from the workplace to nights out on the town. Effects can range from increased attraction (romantically and sexually) to increased confidence, respect, engagement, sociability/likability and even boosted moods. However, pheromones aren't an end-all be-all, especially when it comes to attraction. They are another tool at your disposal, and without the proper know-how, a tool is useless.

**Social Skills**

It’s important to know that pheromones won't do all the work for you. You still need to be on top of your game. Keep yourself in shape, stay fresh, clean and presentable, and keep working on your social prowess if you are lacking there. You still need to know how to read and talk to people to get the most out of pheromone products.

Everyone has to start somewhere, and social skills are something you can improve on. Pheromones can help here by increasing attraction and making others more receptive to you in approaching and talking to them, and also by keeping them engaged, creating more opportunities in which you can build your social skills. They can also help increase your confidence, especially after you've seen their effects in action.

As far as attraction, you might notice indicators of interest (IOIs) from others such as gazing/staring, double-takes, DIHL (deer-in-the-headlights) type looks, hair preening, flipping/twirling (from women) and hovering/"stalking," or where others stay in a close vicinity or pass by multiple times. These can be signs that someone is interested in you, and you should act on these signs quickly if you think there is interest. Approach/open them, chat them up and tease/flirt with them to test how open they are to your advances. You may be rejected a fair amount, but that's okay. We learn through failure, and if you are learning, that is a step in the right direction.

**The Numbers Game**

Finding a sexual/romantic partner is partly a numbers game and pheromones can increase your odds there. For example, 2 or 3 people out of 100 may be attracted to you without pheromones, but with them, this number might be boosted to around 10 out of 100. However, pheromones won't magically make every person attracted to you, and if you are looking to attract a specific person, your odds will be lower.

Some just won't be attracted to you no matter what you do. Sorry, but if you’re looking to lock down a crush who doesn't like you or get back an ex, usually it's just best to move on; there are plenty of fish in the sea. Not to say it won’t work, but I’d say it’s not worth your time, mental well-being or money (kind of a waste of product, IMO), but you do you.

**Fixing Relationships**

When it comes to fixing relationship issues, while pheromones can have some positive effects, they won't solve your problems. They won't fix deep-seated issues like trust, communication, or unresolved conflicts. For instance, molecules like (alpha/beta) androstenol can increase openness and emotional connection, while androstenone can boost sexual attraction. However, these effects are temporary and dependent on the existing relationship dynamics. If there’s underlying tension or mistrust, pheromones can’t fix those problems - they might just "patch" over them for a bit.

Sometimes there might be hormonal changes in your partner, such as those brought on by menopause, pregnancy, postpartum phases, or even stress and aging. While pheromones can have some influence, their impact will depend on the situation. Hormonal fluctuations can significantly affect mood, libido, and emotional connection, and while pheromones may provide some temporary benefits, they won’t directly address the hormonal root cause.

**Choosing Pheromones**

When it comes to finding pheromone products to use, find products that match your desired goals and outcomes from reputable companies. These companies will have products that serve different purposes which can range from likability/sociability to sexual/romantic attraction, respect/authority and more.

Products may come in an oil or alcohol base. Oil products diffuse slower and last longer on the skin. They may come off as more natural and believable and may be better suited for warmer or hot weather/environments. Alcohol sprays diffuse quicker, wider and hit faster and harder than their oil counterparts, though the signals they give off may not be as natural. They also may not have the longevity that oils do due to the faster rate of diffusion. Oils may be a better option in closer quarters or warmer weather/environments. Sprays might be better for more open spaces and cooler weather and busier environments.

Some products come with "cover scents" already blended in and some come unscented. Many will give you the option to add an in-house cover scent. What these cover scents do is help hide undesirable smells, as some pheromone molecules such as NONE and copulins can be quite pungent. Cover scents can also increase diffusion of the pheromone molecules to increase the effective range and enhance their effects. If going unscented, you can use your own fragrances like colognes, EDTs and perfumes as a cover scent.

**Pheromone Companies**

[S1ck Shop](https://s1ckshop.com/?rfsn=7859813.7d5ee4) \- men's and women's products

*\*Note that Aroma Fero sells products from some of the other companies.*

Check out the products these companies offer, going over their descriptions and goals as well as reviews, if available. Besides looking in this sub, do a bit of research about products that interest you by searching/browsing the PheroTruth archive, DiscoverXS forum, and the new Pherotruth 2.0 forum. There are a lot of reviews and reports of products there with some great information.

Some companies will tell you what (some of) their ingredients are as far as pheromone molecules in their blends. pheromoneXS, Pheromone Treasures and Aroma Fero offer single molecules for purchase as well. When you become more advanced and know how these molecules work, you may look into creating some of your own personal blends for experimentation and use.

**Using and Applying Pheromones**

Pheromones are best applied to clean, dry skin. Most users apply them to pulse points where you would normally apply fragrances, such as the neck, wrists, chest and behind the ear. Other areas may include the back of neck, elbow creases and around the navel.

Try to only use one product at a time before mixing/combining. You will need to experiment to find what products work for you and what dosage works well for you. This can be anywhere from 1 to 3+ drops or sprays (or a measurement of swipes in the case of roller bottles).

After you've gotten a product to try out, it's generally recommended to start small as far as dosage. Usually this will be 1 drop or spray. Test that for a few days. Take a day off, then use 2 for a few days. Take another day off then use 3 for a few days, etc. Note the effects on others and yourself, compare to your baseline without pheromones, and see what dosage works well for you.

This process can be a bit of a pain, I know, but that's just part of pheromone use. After you've figured out what works for you and what they do, then you can start mixing different blends together as combos for different or enhanced effects.

**Cover Scents**

Some pheromones products will already be scented, but some may also offer the option to purchase unscented. If choosing an unscented product, you can use your own fragrance of choice to help aid in diffusion, increasing projection and sillage. You might also use cover scents with pre-scented products as long as the fragrances are similar or don't clash. Many fragrances are alcohol-based, and these can help oils to hit harder and faster if you find they are working a bit slowly.

If using cover scents, you can wait for the pheromone application to dry and then apply your fragrance of choice over the app points, or vice versa – apply the fragrance, wait for it to dry, then apply the pheromones. You may also apply your fragrance near the app points; just find out what works for you.

**Cleaning Pheromones**

When you are done using pheromones for the day, CLEAN THEM OFF WELL if you will be using them again the next day. This is an important step. Pheromones can build up and when you use more the next day and the next. This build-up can cause negative effects such as "ghosting" (others avoiding or ignoring you), intimidation, or aggression. Some may have trouble sleeping with NONE or be lethargic the next day with DIENONE. Sometimes pheromones can also cause strange, vivid dreams.

You can use soap and water and scrub your application points well to clean them off, but witch hazel or alcohol can be more effective to clean off pheromones, and these can be found in the form of wipes for convenience. Like many other users, I prefer witch hazel to clean off pheromones as they seem to work very well.

**Congruency**

Note that with some products you will need to act congruently to the blend. This just means acting the part of the vibe that the pheromones present. For example, if you have a sexy, bad boy product, be that sexy bad boy. Have an alpha leader product? Be that confident, leading alpha.

We all act differently according to different situations and with different people naturally. Being congruent is much the same. We must act according to the vibe we are presenting. If not, others might subconsciously think that something is off like you’re not who the pheromones say you are, causing conflict in how you are perceived.

You may need to remind yourself to be congruent, though some blends will naturally bring out the role you need with extended use and acceptance of the signature as your own. Just remember to smile, approach, keep your body language positive, and be genuine.

**Conclusion, The Magic is in YOU**

There you have it - the basics of pheromones. Hopefully this is enough to get you started. Remember to do your research, be patient and experiment with use. It can take some time to learn how various products work and how to incorporate them into different aspects of your life.

And know that pheromones are not magic. Guys, they won't have women chasing you in droves like one of those old Axe commercials. Think of them as an accessory or extension to yourself like your clothing, fragrances, shoes, hairstyle, watches, sunglasses, etc. Pheromones are just part of the equation, though they can give you a nice edge as they can help increase confidence, capture attention and give better first impressions of yourself to others.

With these points in mind, remember that the magic lies in you. Apply the pheromones. Smile. Be confident, personable and genuine, and you should be good to go. Good luck out there!

### Review 3 - "Do Pheromones Work? Androstadienone and Androstenone"

As a pheromone enthusiast, I've always been captivated by the unseen world of scent and its influence on our social interactions. The concept that a single molecule could significantly impact our romantic and social lives is nothing short of extraordinary.

&amp;#x200B;

When I first delved into the world of pheromones in 2011, I was skeptical. Could these individual compounds genuinely enhance attraction and influence behavior? But as I explored further, I discovered a community of individuals who shared similar experiences and observations.

&amp;#x200B;

I began experimenting with different blends, combining single molecules with various colognes. I noticed subtle changes in the way people interacted with me. Conversations seemed to flow more smoothly, smiles were more frequent, and there was a noticeable boost in my confidence. It felt as if I had unlocked a secret weapon in the realm of attraction.

&amp;#x200B;

But the journey wasn't just about attracting others. It was also about understanding myself better. I became more aware of my own reactions and emotions. I noticed how different scents affected my mood and behavior. It was a journey of self-discovery as much as it was about understanding others.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the most thrilling aspects of being a pheromone enthusiast is the constant learning and experimentation. Every day brings new discoveries and insights. It's like being both a scientist and a subject in your own personal laboratory of attraction.

&amp;#x200B;

And the best part? Sharing these discoveries with others. Whether it's discussing the latest research on pheromones, sharing personal experiences, or helping newcomers navigate the world of pheromones, the sense of community is truly enriching.

&amp;#x200B;

So, if you're curious about the world of pheromones, I encourage you to dive in. Start with a single molecule or a blend, and see where the journey takes you. Remember, it's not just about the destination, but the journey itself.  Let's get into some of the more scientific parts of pheromones colognes next.  


# The Power of Attraction:  Androstenone and Androstadienone

&amp;#x200B;

In the world of fragrances, the quest for that elusive scent that can captivate and allure is never-ending. But what if we told you that the secret to attraction might not be a secret after all? Enter Androstenone and Androstadienone, two potent compounds that have been stirring up a storm in the realm of olfactory research.

&amp;#x200B;

Androstenone, a pheromone found in boars and synthesized by humans, has been linked to human attraction and mate selection\[\^1\^\]. It's like a secret ingredient that can spice up your love life. The perception of Androstenone varies among individuals, with some finding it sweet and pleasant, while others liken it to the smell of urine\[\^1\^\]. This unique characteristic makes it a fascinating ingredient in the world of fragrances.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, Androstadienone, often referred to as the "love pheromone," has been found to directly affect behaviour in human males, increasing cooperative behaviour in decision-making tasks\[\^3\^\]. It's like a secret weapon for boosting attractiveness.

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine the possibilities when these two are combined into a single perfume. A scent that not only enhances your natural allure but also influences mood and behaviour. A fragrance that works differently for everyone, creating a personalized scent experience\[\^1\^\].

&amp;#x200B;

This magical blend could potentially signal dominance and masculinity\[\^1\^\], making the wearer irresistible. It could also sync with hormonal fluctuations in women, making them more sensitive to the scent during the fertile phase of their menstrual cycle\[\^1\^\].

&amp;#x200B;

While the role and effectiveness of Androstenone and Androstadienone in humans is a topic of ongoing debate\[\^2\^\], the potential for exciting discoveries is immense. The blend of these two compounds could revolutionize the fragrance industry, creating a new frontier in fragrance research.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite the ongoing debate, both Androstenone and Androstadienone are widely used in the fragrance industry\[\^1\^\]. They are often added to perfumes and colognes to enhance their attractiveness, making them tried-and-true ingredients in the world of fragrances.

&amp;#x200B;

# How to Use Pheromones

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to using pheromones, less is often more. You want to use the minimal effective amount. Applying too much can be overwhelming and may have the opposite effect of what you're aiming for. Start with a small amount and gradually increase until you find what works best for you.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember, pheromones aren't a magic potion. They won't turn a "loser" into a "hero." But they can help boost your confidence and make you feel more attractive. And that can make a big difference in how people perceive you.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the best ways to use pheromones is to combine them with a cover cologne or perfume. This can help mask the natural scent of the pheromones, which some people may find unpleasant. 

&amp;#x200B;

A popular choice among pheromone enthusiasts, a best kept secret is Lacroy's New Pheromone Additive (NPA) - Which is a blend of Androstenone with varying similar molecules to balance the effect just right but still being very prominent. Just add a 1 - 4 drops to your skin or clothes, with a cover cologne preferably.

Also watch out for other males, there can be competitive aggression in some instances.

Edit: Liquid Alchemy Labs products can be found at [Royal pheromones](https://royalpheromones.com) a 20 yr old vendor with great track record.  A314 and PheromoneXS are two other good options.  As well as lacroy that I mentioned.

### Review 4 - "2019 Pheromones to use by Pheromone XS"

Okay this is mostly for the guys since I can't really comment on the women's blends. But I have a 5 year background using pheromones. Some from Androtics Direct, and the rest from Pheromone XS which I discovered late 2014. I've been an avid user ever since!   


The first on the list is   
[XIST](https://pheromonexs.com/xist-pheromone-oil-for-men.html?tracking=59c6e743e0aaf)! - I've been through 3 bottles of this stuff. 2 bottles of oil, and 1 bottle of 30 ml spray. I can't get enough. I also use it at a lot higher levels than most people. 4 drops of XiSt oil is perfect to have the pheromones oozing off of me and into the nose of my targets. The way it works is subtle at first but once it starts settling in, you'll really see what it's doing. It resets any thoughts of "friendzone" in the target. It starts chipping away at their resistances and makes them see you as boyfriend material. It's definitely a product that gets better the more you expose your target to it.  


\# 2 on the list  
[Taboo](https://pheromonexs.com/taboo-xs-pheromone-spray-for-men30.html?tracking=59c6e743e0aaf) \- This is a blend I mostly use when I want that extra kick of attraction. It works best on younger women. Like 18-24. But I've also found it worked pretty well on an older woman who was young at heart. I'm talking about she was 48 but very childlike lol. She particularly liked taboo much more than some of the younger women I've exposed to it. But different people respond differently to different pheromones. But overall, this blend is great. It is just enough attraction to be intriguing, but not too sexual that it turns people off during the day and at work. It's easily usable by the average man and doesn't require much effort in "steering" which is something people do in advanced pheromone usage.  


Next up, something both women and men can use  
[Copulins](https://pheromonexs.com/copulins-cops-dpg.html?tracking=59c6e743e0aaf) \- Formerly known as Desire Me. This is straight synthetic copulins, with some powerful ass STANK. It smells very pungent, but it gets the job done. What job? Well, just think of it this way. Copulins are what women naturally secrete when they're in their prime reproductive capacity.  When used by men, it signifies that you've recently been around highly desirable women. It can work in multiple ways. It makes women subconsciously wonder "This guy is sleeping around, maybe he's highly desirable!" It also works when women wear them. It can give you that "glow" during all points of your cycle. There are studies done that women are actually able to control men with copulins, so it gives women a lot of social power to get what they want.   


That's it for now, There are other experimental pheromones that are great but I don't want to introduce advanced concepts to this subreddit. Seems like a relatively inactive subreddit, so let's start here with the basics.
