# Pheromone Parfums Blog

This is the static blog component of the Autonomous Pheromone Review Blog system. It's built with Eleventy (11ty) and designed to be deployed to Cloudflare Pages.

- `_includes/` - Layout templates and components
- `content/` - Blog posts and pages
- `css/` - Stylesheets

3. Commits the reviews as Markdown files to the `content/blog` directory
4. Triggers a rebuild of the site via Cloudflare Pages
