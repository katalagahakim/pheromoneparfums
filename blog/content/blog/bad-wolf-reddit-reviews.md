## Bad Wolf - Reddit User Reviews

We've collected **5 real user reviews** from r/pheromones. Here's what people are saying:


### Review 1 - "Which Pheromone Cologne is the Best? What should I get next?"

Pic of my collection.  Let's have a discussion, what is your favorite all time pheromone fragrance and why? i am trying to decide on what to buy next! I am leaning towards NA Gel I have a sample of it currently. 

My personal favorites 


Bad Wolf Pheromone Cologne (I like to layer it with OG Wolf)


Aqua Vitae 


cohesion (got crush now I'm looking to use in its place potentially)


New Pheromone Additive


Voodoo when paired with an alpha
Molecule C (TAC) is a nice pair with androstenone formulas. 


Wolf - all time favorite everyday wear when not feeling like playing alpha competitiveness with anyone. Light and fun but still status and sociable.  Attracts younger women too people don't realize. 


A314 love this as an everyday wear when you're not feeling as friendly but still want respect.


Dirty Primitive for when you vabbing at the gym.


What are you wearing tonight and should I add it to my collection? I want to see your collection next!

### Review 2 - "Top 5 Pheromones for Men"

My top 5, in no particular order:

**Bad Wolf (Pre-2019) by LAL (Alpha/Sexual)**

This one is just...Wow! Bring out the cocky, sexy bad boy in you and embrace the experience. Know that you will be shit tested by men and women. Be prepared! Stay congruent to your bad ass signature, and attain respect from men and sexual attraction from women.

Lots of IOI's (indicators of interest - stares, hair flipping, DIHL, or a "deer-in-headlights" type look - think of someone wide-eyed and in awe). Note that younger (18-24) or shy women may be intimidated by your raw, sexual "alphaness."

I always buy unscented and use my own cologne as a cover for most pheromones, but the Bad Wolf original scent isn't bad. I prefer the pre-2019 version of BW. The new version just doesn't seem to be as potent.

It can be a bit of a hassle ordering from the LAL website due to circumstances beyond their control, so I would suggest ordering BW from Aroma Fero.

BW is an oil. For myself, I usually use 3 drops. I always order my pheromones unscented and use my own cover, but Bad Wolf's standard mixed-in cover scent is fine.

**Xist by PXS (Romantic)**

This one is great for romancing and comforting/bonding with women. It's a very lovey-dovey, crushy mix. Nice IOI's (indicators of interest); Women (especially significant others) will feel more comfortable touching you (referred to as "kino"). It even has the ability to help you escape the friend zone, provided you are capable with the proper know-how. This will require multiple exposures with your target.

Just be wary of "fallout." What's fallout? It's a phenomenon where an individual develops deepened romantic feelings for the pheromone wearer. It can happen to women you're not interested in and can lead to infatuation and stalkerish behavior. It can also affect the user as well, so be careful less you catch a case of oneitis with someone whom you didn't intend...

Xist comes as a spray or oil. I use 1-2 sprays.

**Alpha Treasures by PT (Alpha/Status/Attraction)**

AT is perfect for the workplace and also makes for great daily wear. It garners respect and conveys a sense of leadership to others. It also has a nice sexual attraction element to it and others just seem to admire you. AT mixes well with Xist (from my experience and depending on your goals).

Look, I'll be honest...Pheromone Treasures' customer service is pretty much nonexistent, but I have never failed to receive an order from them, and they really do have some great products. You can also order their products on Aroma Fero.

AT is an oil product. 2 drops for myself.

**Evolve by PXS (Alpha/Social/Sexual)**

This mix slowly evolves over the course of the night from social to sexual, allowing for smooth and natural escalation. This one is great on dates or in bars and clubs for closing, or sealing the deal.

IME evolve seems to perform very well with younger ladies (18-23). Lot's of IOIs - hair flipping, DIHL, staring. Mixes quite well with Xist.

Evolve comes in both spray and oil form. 1-2 sprays for myself, depending on how I'm feeling.

**XSP96 by PXS (Romantic/Beautifier, Buffer/Amplifier when mixed with other products)**

Romantic and crushy, similar to A1 (androstadienone), but without the A1 depression. It has "beautifying" effects where others and surroundings seem more aesthetically pleasing and just beautiful in general. It also makes for a great add-on/buffer to many other blends including Bad Wolf, Alpha Treasures and Evolve.

XSP96 comes as a spray. 2 sprays for me.

Links here: [Top 5 Pheromones for Men (@topmones4men) • Link in Bio (linknbio.com)](https://linknbio.com/topmones4men)

Pheromone XS has a 45-day money back guarantee for their products above except for XSP96.

Pheromone Treasures has a 60-day money back guarantee, but I honestly don't know if they'll even answer your emails...

These are my top 5 picks as far as pheromones for men. What are yours?

### Review 3 - "Bad Wolf Experience"

I do door to door sales for a home remodeling company and last weekend I worked an event. 
I am new to pheromones and I just tried Bad Wolf to see if it could help. 
I won’t get into all the details now but I can provide more context in comments if anyone is interested. Basically I had a lady cry , scream &amp; curse at me, then hug me twice and say sorry. She said she felt a connection with me , then started more cursing and emotional behavior. It was the strangest attempt at providing someone a free estimate on some windows I have ever experienced , and I have seen lots of different reactions. Anyone notice Bad Wolf seems to make others angry at you ? Anyway to lessen those effects but keep the other effects. I like how I felt mentally and physically, but I don’t want people angry at me all day that will kill my sales .

# Pheromone Colognes

# Your Journey Starts Here

This is a quick guide to get you started with pheromone products quickly. While it's a whole world when it comes to using pheromones and the deep you go the more there's to learn, I believe this thread should suffice and allow you to more or less get an understanding,

Table of contents

\- What are pheromones (briefly)  
\- Types of pheromone blends  
\- What should you get first  
\- How to test and what reaction to look for  
\- Overdosing  
\- Quick list of products  
\- Pro Tips

# What are pheromones ?

So very briefly if you don't already know, pheromones are small chemicals that the body produces that signal *something* to the other members of the same species. These chemicals play a large role in how others perceive you on a very primal level.

# Types of pheromone blends

Sexual - Sexual products are designed to make you more attractive sexually as a potential mate  
Social - Social pheromone blends are mainly designed to enhance your social interactions, make you shine among others, make new friends, and make you appear more charismatic.  
Imprinting/bonding - Those are blends that have strong imprinting properties that allow you to imprint yourself upon someone (e.g: make them fall for you)  
Alpha sexual - Those are heavy sexual blends, usually that signal a high-status aura in a way  
Social sexual - Those are products that have both social and sexual properties  
Alpha\* - Those products have an alpha/status aspect to them but don't provide that much sexual attraction as others, primarily used to gain respect (e.g.: Androsterone mixes, Business mixes). With that said those blends will usually have some degree of sexual or social aspect  
Work safe\* - Those products are considered safe enough not to get you into trouble at work

**If you want to keep it simple just use the first 3 classifications when you search for a product (Sexual, Social, and Imprinting), with time you will begin to distinguish them.**

Note: Products can have different aspects to them, each product is unique, we classify them as the above to make it easier to understand what's the main effect of it.

# What should you get first?

The honest answer is it depends on who you currently are and what you're looking for. The general suggestion is to first get a sexual and a social product (can be social sexual and alpha sexual, doesn't matter) and maybe an imprinting product as a third one as they can be sometimes more tricky to work with.

Sexuals can help you appear more attractive but sometimes if you're attractive but not really approachable (or intimidating) you could use a good social pheromone to get people around you.

# How to test and what to look for?

After you choose your first product(s) it's time to go out and test them. First thing you might ask yourself is how much to apply and where.

# Dosage and application

The usual places people apply are the wrists, neck, and pulse point, basically where you would a normal perfume.

Vendors will often point out a recommended dosage to use, which you could do. But the best practice is to try one dose at a time. E.g:

First day you got out with one spray/drop/dap applied, see the reactions and note them.  
Second day you try two sprays/drops/daps  
Etc.

# What to look for/how do you know it's working

Sometimes it's easy to notice, that when you apply a product and go outside, immediately you see massive signs of people behaving differently toward you, which can be a sign that the product does its job.

\- People are more receptive to you  
\- People talk to you more  
\- You get smiles, indicators of interest  
\- Sexual cues  
\- Long states  
\- Better conversations  
\- Clinginess  
\- Shyness around you  
\- Submissiveness  
\- Intense stares (classic deer in the headlight)  
\- Etc

Try to be more aware when you first go out with a new product and see if you feel/see anything different throughout your day.

# Overdosing

I think this concept should be addressed in the beginner stage. If you use too much product, the effects can backfire a little be. Most commonly if you apply too much you can get ghosted, and people can just feel uncomfortable being around you.

Indicators of overdosing

\- Ghosting  
\- Avoidance  
\- Weird conflictful reactions  
\- Fight or flight mode from people  
\- Etc

To avoid this just test the product slowly. For example, if you have a dropper test one drop at a time, each time see if the effects get better with every additional drop, if it starts getting worse, you know you're reaching (or reached) the overdose. Then you'll be able to find the sweet spot of it all.

# Quick list of products

AscendXS - Social  
Cohension -Sexual

TUSC - Social, Status formula

# LaCroy Chemicals

# Pheromone Treasures

**Pro tips**

\- Keep a journal, this will help you in your journey of self-improving and keeping track of what works for you.

\- Wash the application points well after you're done. Some product molecules stick around so wash them well

\- Read or ask around from people who have used a particular product before you (that can save you time)

\- Develop yourself and don't just rely on pheromones, it's always important if you're looking to attract someone, it's worth developing your social, dating, and seduction skills. Pheromones give you an edge and can open doors but you have to make the effort

\- Experiment and be open-minded

Good luck

### Review 5 - "Possible Decrease in Libido from Pheromone Use?"

Hey everyone,

I've been experimenting with various pheromone products recently, and I've noticed something interesting.

I've been feeling noticeably calmer than before. For example, when I'm out walking in public, I used to feel quite self-conscious and aware of other people's eyes on me. But now, since using pheromones, I find myself walking with more confidence and less concern about how I'm perceived.

This new sense of internal calm has led me to another realization — about libido.

Before using pheromones, I would often feel aroused just by seeing an attractive woman. But lately, that impulsive reaction seems to have mellowed out. It's not that I'm uninterested — it's more like I'm composed, grounded, and less driven by immediate urges.

So it got me wondering... could this be a decrease in libido? Or is it just that my baseline confidence and stability are improving to the point where I'm less reactive?

The products I've been using and noticing these effects from include:  
**Bad Wolf**, **Possess Alpha**, **Dirty Primitive**, and **Copulins**.

Has anyone else experienced something similar?
