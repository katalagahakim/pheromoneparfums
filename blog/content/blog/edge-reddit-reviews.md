## Edge - Reddit User Reviews

We've collected **5 real user reviews** from r/pheromones. Here's what people are saying:


### Review 1 - "I did 7 girls using pheromones"

Not a troll not a joke. Wether it’s the placebo effect or the actual pheromones. It works. I had this summer job where I made a lot of disposable income. Therefore I had more to spend and I had way more fun. I got lots of women coming to me. 

My theory is when you feel good you look good. I didn’t use pheromones that summer but when I did use pheromones I had a similar effect, wether it was the placebo or I actually did seem more attractive due to the pheromones it worked. 

If you’re wondering about pheromones they do work. If you think they’re going to get you super models while you sit around on the couch eating Doritos you’re wrong. They just give you edge. 

If you need that boost in confidence. Pheromones definitely do work!

### Review 2 - "Pheromones – What They Are, How They Work and More"

**What exactly are pheromones?**

Pheromones are chemical signals that organisms, including us humans, release into their environment. They’re invisible little messengers that spark a reaction in others of the same species. Whether it's to attract a mate, mark territory, or even signal danger, these compounds are doing a lot of behind-the-scenes work that you don’t even realize.

In animals, pheromones are incredibly powerful and precise. Think of how ants march in perfect lines or how some animals "mark" their space. These are all pheromone-driven behaviors.

**Do Humans Even Have Functional Pheromones?**

Unlike many animals, humans don’t rely on pheromones for communication as blatantly as other species do, but pheromones still influence human behavior – just more subtly.

Here are some of the key players when it comes to human pheromones:

* Androstenone (alpha vibes, dominance, sexual attraction)
* Alpha Androstenol (social butterfly, friendlier aura)
* Androstadienone (comfort and bonding, emotional warmth)

But here's the thing: our vomeronasal organ (VNO), the structure that helps many animals detect pheromones, is considered nonfunctional in us humans. So how are we picking up on these signals?

**Vertebrates, Pheromones, and the Olfactory System**

Many animals detect pheromones using their VNO, but vertebrates (including us) have evolved to have two olfactory systems:

1. Main olfactory system – the one responsible for your sense of smell.
2. Accessory olfactory system (VNO) – primarily for pheromone detection in some species, but inactive or less functional in others, like humans.

While the human VNO is a controversial topic and thought by many researchers to be a vestigial organ, studies suggest we might be detecting pheromones through our regular olfactory system, particularly through the main olfactory epithelium – the same one that helps you enjoy the smell of fresh coffee or a good cologne.

**So, How Do Pheromones Work in Humans?**

While it’s true our VNO might be nonfunctional, some researchers believe pheromones still affect our brains through other pathways, particularly in regions tied to mood, emotion, and attraction. When someone is exposed to a pheromone, it could stir up sexual attraction, boost confidence, or make them seem more dominant or approachable, depending on the pheromone.

Even though we may not "smell" pheromones in the traditional sense (though some people can still smell certain pheromones), our brains respond to them. We just don’t fully understand the mechanisms yet.

**The Decline in Hormones and What It Means for Pheromones**

Let’s talk about hormone levels – testosterone, in particular. Over the past few decades, testosterone levels in men have been on the decline. Some studies show that men today have lower testosterone levels compared to men just 20–30 years ago.

This may be due to various factors such as more sedentary lifestyles, stress, lack of adequate sleep, poor diets and the prevalence of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) such as BPA, pthalates and parabens. EDCs can be found in everyday items like plastics, receipts, personal care products (shampoos, lotions, perfumes), pharmaceuticals, food products, etc. They are everywhere!

Why does this matter for pheromones? Testosterone is directly linked to the production of certain pheromones, like androstenone, the powerhouse molecule associated with dominance and sexual attraction. As testosterone levels drop, so does the body's ability to produce pheromone signals. This hormonal decline might explain why some people feel that natural attraction has diminished and why pheromone products have become more popular to help restore that edge.

**But Do Pheromone Products Actually Work?**

You bet!

Official researchers and most members of the public are skeptical or may even scoff at the idea of pheromones having any effect on us. Despite decades of research, scientists have struggled to find definitive proof that human pheromones work the same way as they do in animals. Human behavior is influenced by a variety of factors, and isolating the impact of pheromones in controlled studies has proven difficult. Some studies show effects, while others don't, making the science feel inconclusive​​.

However, independent researchers such as ones from the now defunct forums Pherotruth (original) and Pherotalk have experimented with pheromones for the past few decades in real-life situations with positive results. This has led to the formulation of pheromone products as we know them today.

Not all pheromone blends are effective, though. Recently there have been many new pheromone companies and products popping up all over social media, but many of these have proved to be ineffective or weak at best. Luckily there are several pheromone companies with tried-and-true products that have been used by pheromone enthusiasts for years. Still, not every product will work for everyone, so some experimenting is required.

**Why Should You Care About Pheromones?**

If you're someone looking to:

* Boost your social confidence
* Create stronger emotional connections
* Increase odds of attraction
* Gain more respect and authority
* Have a little fun experimenting with the psychology of attraction

Then pheromones could be your opportunity. The best part? It’s a wide-open field of experimentation for anyone to join. Whether it’s using products like Wolf for that “trustworthy leader” vibe, or Grail of Affection (GOA) to deepen emotional connections, there’s something for everyone to try.

### Review 3 - "Neurosteroids Have Clear, Measurable Effects—It’s the Pheromone Label That’s Contested"

###Neurosteroids Have Clear, Measurable Effects—It’s the Pheromone Label That’s Contested

Neurosteroids such as androstenone and its derivatives consistently elicit detectable responses across multiple domains—behavioral, physiological, and neurological—in humans. The debate surrounding their classification as pheromones stems not from a lack of evidence for these effects, but from disagreement over whether they meet the rigid criteria established for pheromones in other species (e.g., innate, species-specific, stereotyped responses). By focusing on the effects themselves, rather than the label, it becomes clear that these compounds function as potent chemosignals with significant influence, regardless of terminology.

1. **Neurological Effects Are Well-Documented**
   - Studies like Savic et al. (2001) demonstrate that androstadienone triggers sex-specific hypothalamic activation in women, a region linked to reproductive and emotional processing, using positron emission tomography (PET). This response is measurable and repeatable, showing that the brain registers these compounds distinctly from typical odors. Similarly, Pause (2004) found that androstenone sensitivity correlates with altered spatial preferences, suggesting a subconscious neural processing pathway. These findings indicate a clear neurobiological impact, whether or not it fits the pheromone mold of eliciting overt, universal behaviors.

2. **Physiological Responses Are Consistent and Quantifiable**
   - Research such as Wyart et al. (2007) shows that androstadienone exposure elevates cortisol levels in women, a hormonal shift measurable in blood plasma. Grosser et al. (2000) reported changes in autonomic markers like skin conductance and heart rate, further evidencing a bodily reaction to these steroids. These physiological shifts occur reliably under controlled conditions, proving that the compounds interact with human systems in a tangible way—irrespective of whether they trigger mating dances or other classic pheromone hallmarks seen in animals.

3. **Psychological and Behavioral Impacts Are Subtle but Real**
   - Jacob &amp; McClintock (2000) found that androstadienone reduces negative mood in women, a subtle yet statistically significant effect confirmed through self-reports and mood scales. Kirk-Smith &amp; Booth (1978) showed that androstenol alters social judgments, influencing how individuals perceive others in controlled settings. While these effects lack the dramatic, fixed responses of, say, a sow’s lordosis to boar androstenone, they undeniably register as shifts in cognition and emotion, modulated by context and individual differences. The subtlety doesn’t negate their existence—it simply challenges the pheromone definition’s emphasis on stereotypy.

4. **The Debate Is Semantic, Not Empirical**
   - Critics like Doty (2010) and Wysocki &amp; Preti (2004) argue that these neurosteroids don’t qualify as pheromones because they lack the specificity and universality seen in insect or rodent models—e.g., androstenone’s precise role in pig mating. However, even these skeptics acknowledge the compounds’ effects; Doty proposes "social chemosignals" as a better term, while Wysocki notes measurable responses but questions their ecological relevance. This highlights that the contention is about nomenclature, not the reality of the effects. The evidence of impact—brain activation, hormone shifts, mood changes—stands firm, even if it doesn’t conform to a 1959 definition of pheromones crafted for ants and moths.

5. **Human Complexity Explains Variability, Not Absence of Effect**
   - Unlike animals with simpler pheromone systems (e.g., vomeronasal organ-driven responses), humans exhibit variability in sensitivity to androstenone—about 50% can’t smell it due to genetic polymorphisms (e.g., OR7D4 receptor variations; Keller et al., 2007). Yet, even anosmic individuals show physiological responses (e.g., cortisol changes), suggesting a broader chemosensory mechanism beyond conscious olfaction. This variability, coupled with cultural and contextual influences, dilutes the stereotyped responses expected of pheromones but doesn’t erase the underlying effects. Human complexity refines, rather than refutes, the compounds’ influence.

### Conclusion
The effects of neurosteroids like androstenone are not in question—brain scans, hormone assays, and behavioral data confirm their impact with scientific rigor. What’s debated is whether these effects—often subtle, context-dependent, and variable—fit the traditional pheromone framework, which demands fixed, species-wide reactions. By decoupling the empirical reality from the definitional dispute, it’s evident that these compounds meaningfully alter human physiology and psychology. Call them pheromones, chemosignals, or something else entirely; the responses are real, measurable, and well-registered. The argument, then, is not about *if* they work, but *how* we name their work—a distinction that matters more to taxonomists than to the neurons firing in response.

### Review 4 - "The “Weird Trick” That Made Approaching Women Effortless and Fun (Using Pheromones For Self-Improvement)"

**My most embarrassing approach happened the year after I graduated high school in Australia. Picture this: lunchtime at a bustling trade school, filled with ambitious young men chasing apprenticeships, their chatter echoing off brick walls, the air thick with bravado and cheap cologne.**

One afternoon during lunch, the atmosphere suddenly shifted a stunning blonde walked across the courtyard, effortlessly turning every head in her direction.

She was the kind of girl you’d spot from a mile away, a genuine 10/10.

Here’s the kicker:

I knew her.

Well, sort of.

We’d shared a class the year before, though I’d barely mustered more than a glance her way. Approaching her?

Forget about it. Talking to girls terrified me… especially one who seemed plucked straight out of a movie.

Foolishly, I admitted to recognizing her, and instantly the guys around me smelled blood.

Mind you, most of these guys were older than me, and I was still fresh out of high school.

Nobody cared about that though.

Dares were made (to approach her), and my pride wouldn’t let me back down.

As I walked toward her, it felt as though my shoes were filling with concrete.

**My legs – and I’m not exaggerating here – literally trembled beneath me.**

Imagine that:

... A young man, shaking like a frightened puppy at the thought of a conversation.

It really didn’t help that several of her friends were also nearby as she was only seconds away from sitting down with them. When I engaged her, I had eyes on me from all of them…

Sweat traced its nervous path down my spine as I finally managed to blurt out an awkward greeting, mumbling something nonsensical about last year’s class.

Her eyes flickered with polite confusion.

The encounter fizzled quickly, because I was so nervous.

I made up some silly bullshit and exited the situation after exchanging a few brief and awkward words…

To this day, I’m sure my beet red face, shaky voice and trembling legs are seared into her (and her friends) memories – and provided enough laughter for years to come.

Yep, that’s who I was. Terrified, awkward, clueless, and utterly humiliated.

And that humiliating memory stuck with me.

Fast forward a bit.

There I was, working graveyard shifts as an overnight security guard in a sterile, deserted office building.

Imagine endless hallways, fluorescent lights humming quietly, my footsteps echoing in solitude, my only companions a flashlight and earbuds blaring hours of self-help audiobooks, podcasts, and endless motivational talks.

*I’d become an obsessive student of confidence and charisma.*

Every waking moment, I devoured advice, affirmations, and secrets promising to unlock the bold, magnetic personality hidden inside me.

In my mind, I was morphing into this unstoppable, captivating figure…

The kind who effortlessly drew admiration and attraction.

But reality was far from that…

Even after soaking in all that empowering knowledge, approaching women STILL felt impossible.

Every time I spotted a beautiful woman, I had some excuse – I wasn’t tall, handsome, or rich enough, my breath is bad, I’m not dressed well enough, she’s probably taken… everything under the sun.

At this point, it had already been a pattern for years, and I had no idea how to break out of it and “just do it” without being such a chicken.

“Why am I still like this?” I’d ask myself bitterly, night after lonely night, walking those empty corridors.

The more I studied confidence, the more elusive it became.

And each failed attempt or missed opportunity sent me deeper into self-doubt and frustration.

# How could I possibly absorb so much knowledge but still feel paralyzed in action?

One late night, scrolling through some obscure forum on charisma, I stumbled onto something curious… pheromones.

Special colognes and perfumes promising instant attraction and confidence. Skeptical but desperate, I ordered some.

The products arrived, and oddly intrigued, sprayed some onto my neck.

I didn’t expect much beyond disappointment.

Yet, what I found shortly after was that my mood was better, I felt less inhibited, and it felt like a “fog” I’d been carrying for years were lifted…

**This was my first taste of the powerful “self-effects” of pheromones.**

I eagerly waited for opportunities to see if I was imagining all this, or it was in my head.

Over the next few weeks – to my utter amazement – there definitely seemed like a difference in how women I already knew were interacting with me.

\----------------------------------

As some of you may know, I'm revamping old content on my site \^.\^ I've become a much better writer over the years, and looking over some of my old stuff makes me cringe. 

Anyway, just wanted to recall and share this experience about how pheromones helped overcome crippling anxiety around approaching women many years ago... hopefully it may open other peoples eyes to the amazing use cases of pheromones beyond just attracting women or for making social interactions more interesting. 

Feel free to post any questions.

### Review 5 - "I'm a university student and I'd like to get more attention or at least smell better."

I'm an university student in Europe and wanted to buy a characteristic scent/perfume. I came across this subreddit and was immediately interested, even though I usually approach such products with some skepticism. I thought it could be worth seeking advice since I'm not particularly familiar with pheromones beyond the explanation post in this subreddit and some common knowledge.
