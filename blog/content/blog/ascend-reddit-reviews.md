## Ascend - Reddit User Reviews

We've collected **3 real user reviews** from r/pheromones. Here's what people are saying:


### Review 1 - "2025 Top Pheromone List &amp; Guide"

Figured it was time for an update. My old list post was about six years ago, and since then I‚Äôve refined what actually works for me.

I'll list my recommendations here based on what i've learned.

**My top 3 pheromones this year:**

**#1 ‚Äì XiSt -** [**https://pheromonexs.com/xist-pheromone-oil-for-men.html**](https://pheromonexs.com/xist-pheromone-oil-for-men.html?tracking=59c6e743e0aaf)  
XiSt is still the king for me and I'm still a total sucker for the oil. It‚Äôs the base I build most of my blends around. Funny enough, I did a deep dive on AI just last month to figure out the ‚Äúbest‚Äù pheromone out there, and XiSt came back as the undisputed champ lmao. I sent a screenshot of it to Steveo and he was just as surprised as I wasüòÇ. But it really is the undisputed champ. It's been my daily wear for years and the price has not changed with inflation. That's definitely a plus. The oil goes such a long way.

I almost always pair it with something else. Most often it‚Äôs Taboo, but sometimes Vibes, or Ascend when I want that extra bit of status.

**#2 ‚Äì Vibes (Vibe XS) -** [**https://pheromonexs.com/vibe-xs-pheromone-spray30.html**](https://pheromonexs.com/vibe-xs-pheromone-spray30.html?tracking=59c6e743e0aaf)  
I used to think Vibes was just a basic social mone but I was proven wrong when I used it during my transition into leadership at the office. I ended up managing the people I used to work alongside with, so the transition was kinda hard on me. Giving orders to people who I was once buddy buddy with felt weird. But the Vibes toned down the alpha-ness and lowered their guards. But I noticed that it could kill respect for me if I used it too much so it wasn't my daily wear by any means. Now I mostly use it for parties and weekend outings with my family. But it definitely made it into my list because it's just a good time.

**#3 ‚Äì Alpha Q  -** [**s1ckshop.com**](https://s1ckshop.com/products/pheromone-cologne?_pos=1&amp;_psq=alpha&amp;_ss=e&amp;_v=1.0&amp;variant=39380673036353)

I can't believe I slept on this one for most of my decade long pheromone career lol. I had it sitting on the shelf for a while thinking it was just another status blend. One day I threw it on, and out of nowhere my wife was *thirsty*. It definitely has FIRE that I feel deserves a mention here.

**Miscellaneous Findings:**

[**Copulins** ](https://pheromonexs.com/pheromones-for-women/30ml-spray-pheromones-women/desire-me-xs-plus-pheromone-spray-for-women-30.html?tracking=59c6e743e0aaf)  
I don‚Äôt use copulins much anymore. I used to love the testosterone rush, but it's tough to wear daily. They can throw people off. Not sure how to explain it exactly, but it just didn't match my personality, especially being married now.

I ended up just using them at the gym, but man‚Ä¶ I stank hard and got weird looks. No doubt they boost T, but they also made my wife unnecessarily jealous at times. I think these work way better in the hands of women tbh.

[**Bliss XS**](https://pheromonexs.com/BlissXS-Pheromone-spray-Androsterone-Androstenol-DHEA?tracking=59c6e743e0aaf)  
Holy hell, this is named appropriately. It's like a straight up drug. I have the oil so whenever I'm feeling down I just lather myself with like 4 drops lol

**Where I Apply Pheromones:**

Attraction blends (XiSt, Taboo, Alpha Q) go on the neck. That puts my pheromone cloud up close when I'm face to face with people.

Social blends (Vibes, Bliss, lighter stuff) go on the wrists. I talk with my hands a lot so it diffuses that way.

Sometimes I put the strong stuff on my chest underneath my clothes. Like Evolve or Ascend. That way it's not too intimidating and the clothes kinda mute the diffusion.

I've been using pheromones for over a decade now and have spent over 2k on them, so feel free to ask me any questions!

### Review 2 - "Copulins (Cops) - A Powerful Pheromone for Both Men and Women"

Hey, there. I wanted to go over a quite interesting pheromone called copulins. Now some will say that they are not actually pheromones, but by definition I would regard them as pheromones since they are chemicals naturally secreted by women that have an effect on men.

# What are Copulins?

They are a mix of 5 fatty acids vaginally secreted by women and are most prevalent during ovulation. You may have heard of "vabbing" and I believe copulins is what makes vabbing effective.

# What Do Copulins Do?

In one study (by Astrid Jutte, which I can't seem to find anymore...), they were found to increase perceived attractiveness of women by men. They were also found to increase salivary testosterone levels in one male subject by 149% and differing levels in other male subjects. If I recall correctly there was noticeable a boost in all of the test subjects.

# Copulins for Attraction

Copulins have been known in the pheromone community to help both men and women attract partners of the opposite sex, and even the same sex in the case of lesbian women. When worn by men, they become a kind of social proof to signal the man was recently laid or has simply been around other women, and that he is desirable by other women. When worn by women, they serve as a signal that she is perhaps ovulating and ready to mate. The wearer may be perceived as more attractive than normal to straight men.

# Self-Effects

From my experience as a guy, when I wear cops (especially under the nose), I notice increased confidence, better posture, a noticeable improvement in mood, and harder erections. I also notice that I find myself checking out women I normally wouldn't be that attracted to. What's more, I receive more camaraderie and respect from other straight men. They just think I'm the fucking man lol.

# Negatives

However, when worn by men, copulins can be quite polar with women. Ladies who are ovulating may be more receptive, though younger, shy and/or inexperienced women may be put off. Women who are menstruating probably might not be very receptive and may even find the wearer repulsive.

# Cops Smell

One more thing to note is that copulins can be very stinky, so, if wearing, it's recommended to use a strong cover scent (as with other pheromones) such as perfume or cologne. Oftentimes I will wear it under the nose, but I'm not going to apply a cover to my nose lol. I have grown accustomed to the smell and quite like it, actually. I usually apply a bit of a drop under the nose and the rest below the belly button, using a cover scent just to help with diffusion and to spread the copulin scent. If I'm feeling bold, I might apply a whole drop to each of these areas and maybe split a drop between the wrists.

# Romance and Copulins

Oh, wait...One more thing for the guys - if you are using cops, I generally wouldn't recommend using them with romantic pheromone blends as they can conflict with the romantic vibe you're going after. They do, however, work well with more sexually aggressive blends IME.

# Try Cops for Free

Ladies, if you want to try out copulins for free, you could try vabbing - basically just get some of your vaginal juices and apply to pulse points. Use perfume to cover the scent and help increase diffusion.

Guys, if you want to try cops for free for the self-effects (or maybe some more attention from other ladies or respect from the boys) and have a gf/wife or a lady you can get active with, you can go down on her or do the deedand...uh, kind of leave the juices on your face or body xP

# Where to Buy Cops

As stated earlier, copulins are more prevalent during ovulation, so if you want something more consistent you can order cops from reputable pheromone companies. Don't worry where they came from, though; these copulin products are made synthetically lol.

My company recommendations for pure cops are Aroma Fero, pheromoneXS and Love Potion.

Aroma Fero is located in the UK, and they have the least offensive smelling cops. Theirs comes in a regular dropper bottle.

Love Potion and XS are US-based and XS also has an EU hub. The cops are quite stanky, but this is lessened after dry down. Love Potion's comes in a roll-on bottle and XS a euro dropper.

Love Potion's cops product is called Essence of Woman (EoW) and is marketed as a women's pheromone, but men can use this as well.

XS' cops product is called Desire Me oil and is on the women's pheromone page, but no worries, boys, you can still use this as well. Desire Me oil also contains XS' Diffusion Tech that helps the product with diffusion and spreading the scent, and also boosts longevity to last longer throughout the day.

I also like Liquid Alchemy Labs' (LAL) pure cops, but it can be a bit of a pain ordering as you have to order through email (because PayPal considers pheromones to be drugs, Garry \[LAL owner\] told me) and it seems oftentimes emails don't go through for some odd reason.

# LAL Copulin Blends

LAL has a couple other products containing copulins.

**Dirty Primitive**

Dirty Primitive (DP) is a mix of androstenone, a male sexual pheromone, and cops in a 2:1 ratio. This is a highly sexual pheromone product made for...well, sexual attraction. This one will get women hot and bothered ;)

**Max-T-150**

LAL also has another copulins product called Max-T-150 which is made purely for self-effects. There is no offensive odor with this one, so you won't need a cover scent. It is actually already covered with a light melon scent. It's a lip balm type product, though you don't want to apply it on your lips; most apply it right under their nose. 

Garry said he might apply it to the first knuckle on one hand and just take a whiff whenever he needs a boost. As stated earlier, this one is for self-effects. Can be worn as often as you like. Some users report diminishing returns with prolonged and/or daily use, while others do not.

# Love Potion Blend

Love Potion has a really great pheromone blend for men with cops called The Love God (TLG), created by a well-regarded OG member of PheroTruth. This one has it all and is very well-rounded - status, respect, confidence, attraction, bonding, imprinting. 

Can't say enough good things about this blend, though some users don't find it effective for themselves. Comes in either roll-on, oil/alcohol spray, or alcohol spray. I prefer the alcohol spray as I generally like my mones to hit hard and fast. You'll need a cover scent for this. I like it at around 4-5 sprays for myself, but if you try it, you may want to start with 1-2 sprays.

# pheromoneXS Blends

pheromoneXS also has a few other pheromone blends that include cops for both men and women.

**Desire Me**

For women there is Desire Me Plus. It is a blend of cops and other pheromones designed for women to attract men. This one is considered a staple among many of the lovely ladies in the pheromone community and is described as "sexy in a bottle." It can increase attraction and sociability. Cover scent recommended. Contains Diffusion Tech.

**Ascend**

For men, XS has one product called Ascend that contains cops along with other pheromones. This is an alpha status blend that's great in the workplace or out and about. This has a bit of everything - confidence, status, respect, attraction, and sociability; great all-around product with a smooth, suave, sophisticated alpha kind of vibe. 1 spray is all you need. This will need a cover scent. Contains Diffusion Tech.

**SOB**

XS also has another men's product called SOB, which also contains cops with other pheromones, though its purpose is different. This is a highly sexual product that gives you confidence, boosts sexual attraction and sociability, and gives you some status, but not as much status as Ascend. 

SOB gives you that bad boy, "son of a bitch who gets laid" type aura. Recommended for when you are trying to get laid while out and about, or even with the gf/wifey -- really gets the ladies ready to go ;) 1 spray for this, and you'll need a cover scent. Contains Diffusion Tech.

### Review 3 - "My experience so far (TLDR at the bottomüòÖ)"

So I stumbled across this sub although my interest in pheromones goes back a few years. I‚Äôve always been a person interested in scents. I have a collection of colognes that I‚Äôve enjoyed over the years. The primary partner has also introduced me to a much better world of colognes and scents with natural roll on oils and I have a growing collection there too. Her and I have had a great relationship but the flirting and sexual bits kinda fell off a bit over the past year or so with a bunch of stresses. We‚Äôre both bi so practice a bit of the ENM and have had couples and other guys involved which didn‚Äôt always go great. We lost a pet. We‚Äôve had car troubles, one of which is still under work MONTHS later. Just generally overwhelmed. We live together and that kinda has taken its toll too because we don‚Äôt get the chance to miss each other as much, especially now since we have to carpool everywhere. Work got a bit stressful with some encounters in the office. Just a few coworkers and my manager who generally I was starting to have struggles getting through to them and bickering over little things. And outside in the world just kinda felt overlooked. I‚Äôm generally a pretty confident and outgoing person so talking to people doesn‚Äôt scare me. And I‚Äôm VERY casual about a lot of things. Sometimes people even think I‚Äôm flirting when I‚Äôm not. Right about then was when I found this sub.
So, I figured ‚Äúwhat the hell, why not?‚Äù I can spare $40 to just try something. I ordered the Vibes spray from XS from a post a little bit below. With that they also sent me the trial 3 pack with Love Boat, Ascend, and the one I really wanted but was out of stock Xist. I was skeptical at first. Honestly really didn‚Äôt see much of a difference at first or really think it would work. But I got more consistent wearing them and this is what I‚Äôve noticed‚Ä¶
A bit of the flirting and fun has indeed come back. If even just a little, she has complimented the way I smell more often than before. Even when not wearing deodorant allowing my own natural scent to mix in with the pheromones and cologne. The Love Boat actually seems to work pretty well on her, it is a bit more flirty and playful than sexual but I‚Äôve enjoyed it. I wear it around the house and have even had a few good make out sessions come from it. Even a little bit more fun in the bedroom. I have worn vibes around her with similar results.
Vibes is WONDERFUL. Although my primary target is the partner, the other day at the dentist a few occasions happened a little beyond the just being nice because I‚Äôm their patient. I met a new assistant who was instantly chatty and, being close leaning over me, one of the first things she randomly told me was ‚Äúyou smell nice‚Äù asking what I was wearing (Vibes and just a basic cologne on the neck. And get this, no fresh deodorant. I was actually afraid I smelled bad going into the appointment! üòÇ). Gave her a compliment on her eyes and she seemed to melt a bit. üòèü§åüèº The hygienist, one that was familiar to me but I really haven‚Äôt talked to much, had that look in her eye. She was locked in on me, engaged, and was also super chatty. Around work, coworkers and manager seem a bit more disarmed and less likely to bicker with me about little things.

Time for a TLDR;

I was skeptical but after just a few weeks of wearing I can potentially see that these things work. Especially Vibes. I‚Äôm not focusing too much on making sure they‚Äôre working, just adding them to my arsenal with my general charm and personality. Excited to try others and definitely open to recommendations. I will also report back occasionally on anything else I notice throughout my experience wearing them.
