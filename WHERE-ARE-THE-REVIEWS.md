# Where Are The Reviews? üîç

## Current Status

### **What You See NOW (Local):**
- ‚úÖ **7 existing reviews** - These are in `blog/content/blog/*.md`
- ‚úÖ Beautiful new theme with gradient backgrounds
- ‚úÖ Working search functionality
- ‚ùå **NO scraped reviews yet** - Scraping only works when deployed to Cloudflare

### **Why No Scraped Reviews Yet?**

The autonomous scraping system **requires Cloudflare environment** to work:

1. **Cloudflare D1 Database** - Stores reviews, products, sources
2. **Cloudflare KV Storage** - Caches data, prevents duplicates
3. **Cloudflare Workers** - Runs the scraping code
4. **OpenAI API** - Analyzes reviews (requires secrets)
5. **GitHub API** - Commits new reviews (requires secrets)

**You can't test scraping locally** - it needs the full Cloudflare infrastructure.

## What Happens When You Deploy?

### **Step 1: Deploy to Cloudflare**
```bash
# Create D1 database
npx wrangler d1 create pheromone_reviews

# Create KV namespace
npx wrangler kv:namespace create "PHEROMONE_KV"

# Update wrangler.toml with IDs

# Run migrations (add 70+ products, 30+ sources)
npx wrangler d1 execute pheromone_reviews --file=./migrations/schema.sql
npx wrangler d1 execute pheromone_reviews --file=./migrations/comprehensive-products.sql
npx wrangler d1 execute pheromone_reviews --file=./migrations/add-more-sources.sql

# Set secrets
npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN
npx wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY

# Deploy
npx wrangler deploy
```

### **Step 2: Trigger First Scrape**
```bash
curl -X POST https://pheromone-parfums.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev/scrape
```

### **Step 3: Watch It Work**

**Within 2-5 minutes:**

1. **Worker starts scraping** 30+ review sources
2. **Fetches reviews** from:
   - Reddit r/pheromones
   - PheroTruth forum
   - Love Scent community
   - PheromoneXS forum
   - Amazon reviews
   - YouTube comments
   - 24+ more sources

3. **Processes each review:**
   - Extracts text, author, rating, date
   - Identifies product name (e.g., "Alfa Maschio")
   - Checks for duplicates
   - Analyzes sentiment with AI
   - Saves to D1 database

4. **Groups reviews by product:**
   - All "Alfa Maschio" reviews together
   - All "Pherazone" reviews together
   - etc.

5. **Generates markdown files:**
   - Creates `blog/content/blog/alfa-maschio.md`
   - Includes ALL reviews for that product
   - Adds metadata (rating, pros, cons)

6. **Commits to GitHub:**
   - Pushes new `.md` files
   - Triggers Cloudflare Pages rebuild
   - **Reviews appear on your site!**

## Example: What A Scraped Review Looks Like

### **From Reddit:**
```markdown
### Review 5 - Rating: 4.5/5

**My Experience with Alfa Maschio**

I've been using Alfa Maschio for about 3 weeks now and
here are my thoughts. The scent is pleasant but strong,
so I only use 2-3 sprays max. I've noticed more eye
contact and women being more chatty/touchy with me...

```

### **From PheroTruth Forum:**
```markdown
### Review 12 - Rating: 5.0/5

**Alfa Maschio Works!**

Been using this for 6 months. Best results when applied
to neck and chest. Gets strong IOIs at bars and clubs.
Mix with good cologne for best effect...
