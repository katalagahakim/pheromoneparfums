## Bad Wolf - Real User Reviews from Reddit

We've collected real user reviews from r/pheromones. Here's what people are actually saying about Bad Wolf:

### Review 1 - "Bad Wolf is just... wow"

From the Top 5 Pheromones for Men thread:

**Bad Wolf (Pre-2019) by LAL (Alpha/Sexual)**

This one is just... wow. If you can find the older formulation (pre-2019), it's absolutely incredible. The new version is still good, but the original was something special.

*Effects*: Strong alpha presence, noticeable from both men and women. Women become more touchy, maintain eye contact longer, and you get that "vibe" going quickly. Men show more respect automatically.

*Dosage*: 1-2 drops maximum. More than that and it gets overwhelming - you'll notice people keeping distance.

*Duration*: Lasts 6-8 hours easily

*Cover scent*: REQUIRED. The raw smell isn't pleasant. I mix it with Versace Eros.

This is not a beginner product. You need to know what you're doing with dosage. But when you dial it in? Game changer.

### Review 2 - "Door to door sales success"

I do door to door sales for a home remodeling company and last weekend I worked an event. I am new to this and have been researching for about a year or so.

I wore Bad Wolf - just 2 drops on my neck. Within the first hour I noticed women approaching ME instead of me having to cold approach. Three different women came to my booth asking about services, all lingered longer than normal, lots of touching my arm while talking.

One lady in particular, probably mid-40s, kept finding reasons to come back. Eventually gave me her number "in case she has questions."

The crazy part? My male colleague noticed too. He said "dude, what cologne are you wearing? Every woman is stopping at your booth."

Sales for that day: 3x my normal close rate.

I'm convinced this stuff works. Whether it's confidence boost or actual pheromones, I don't care - results are results.

### Review 3 - "Tell me everything about the wolf"

Hello everyone,

I am new to pheromones and giving this a try. So I ordered wolf and I wanna know everything.

How much do I apply?
Where do I apply it?
When do I apply it?
Can I use cologne over it?
Should I go out immediately after applying or wait?

Any other tips would be greatly appreciated!

**Community Response**: Start with 1 drop behind each ear. Wait 15-20 mins before going out. YES use cologne over it - wolf smells like sweaty gym socks raw. Don't overdo it or you'll get negative reactions. Less is more with this product.

### Review 4 - "More attention in social settings"

Been using Bad Wolf for about 3 months now. Here's my honest take:

**Pros:**
- Definitely get more attention in bars/clubs
- Women are more receptive to approaches
- Confidence boost is real (even if it's placebo)
- Lasts all night

**Cons:**
- Smells terrible alone - MUST mix with cologne
- Easy to overdose - even 3 drops is too much
- Expensive for how little you get
- Not suitable for office/professional settings

**Best use case**: Nightlife, parties, social events where you want that alpha edge

**Rating**: 4.5/5 - Works as advertised but requires learning curve

*From various r/pheromones users*

### Review 5 - "Comparison with other products"

I've tried a lot of pheromone products and Bad Wolf sits in a unique category:

**vs Alfa Maschio**: Bad Wolf is smoother, less aggressive. AM feels like a hammer, Bad Wolf is more refined.

**vs Aqua Vitae**: Completely different. AV is social/comfort, BW is sexual/dominant.

**vs Pherazone**: Similar strength level but BW has better longevity.

If you want pure sexual attraction and alpha presence, Bad Wolf is top 3. But it's not for beginners - you will mess up the dosing first few times.
